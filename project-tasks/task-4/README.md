# Task 4 – Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi Prototypes

This task contains both the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for the Helena’s Photoart website.

## Contents

- **Low-Fidelity Prototype:** Initial wireframe sketches representing the general structure and layout of the website. These were used to explore ideas and organize content before moving into design details.
- **High-Fidelity Prototype:** A detailed and polished version of the website mockup, including real images, colors, typography, and interactions. This prototype closely reflects the final user interface.

Both prototypes were created to follow Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles

## Tools Used

- Figma (for both lo-fi and hi-fi)
